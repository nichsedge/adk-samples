Logline: A mystic poet's radical declaration of divine unity leads to his persecution and execution, but his message of spiritual enlightenment ultimately endures.

Act I: Introduction to Mansur Al-Hallaj, a charismatic Persian mystic and poet in 9th-century Baghdad. He gains a devoted following through his teachings on Sufism, emphasizing love, divine unity, and the annihilation of the ego. His controversial declaration, "Ana'l-Haqq" ("I am the Truth"), is seen by some as blasphemy and by others as a profound spiritual realization. This attracts the attention of religious and political authorities who view his teachings as a threat to their power.

Act II: Al-Hallaj's influence grows, leading to increased scrutiny and opposition from conservative religious scholars and the Abbasid court. He is accused of heresy and sedition, leading to his arrest and a prolonged period of imprisonment. During his confinement, he continues to teach and inspire his followers, deepening their spiritual understanding. His unwavering conviction in the face of persecution solidifies his image as a martyr for his beliefs.

Act III: Al-Hallaj is put on trial, where he defends his teachings with eloquent arguments about divine love and unity. Despite his powerful defense, he is found guilty and publicly executed. The film concludes by showing how, despite his tragic end, Al-Hallaj's message of spiritual enlightenment and his concept of "Ana'l-Haqq" continue to resonate, making him a revered figure in Sufism and a symbol of spiritual courage.
